			  <img src="img/Limgrave.webp" class="d-block w-100" alt="Limgrave">
			<h3>Limgrave</h3>
			<p>Limgrave is located in the southwestern corner of the Lands Between.
			A temperate land of green plains and golden trees,
			with windswept hills to the north and a dense, mist-shrouded woodland to the east.
			To the south lies the Weeping Peninsula, an isolated region known for its unceasing rain.
			Godrick the Grafted presides over Limgrave from Stormveil Castle, to the northwest, and to the northeast lies the region of Caelid.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="carousel-item">
			  <img src="img/Liurnia.webp" class="d-block w-100" alt="Liurnia">
			<h3>Liurnia</h3>
			<p>Liurnia is the westernmost region of the Lands Between.
			Characterised by its vast forests, sheer cliffs, and ever-present fog, the majority of the region is sinking into a lake.
			On the eastern side, a highroad runs north to south, connecting the area to the regions of Altus Plateau and Limgrave.
			The western coast is closely associated with the Carian royal family, and this is where their Manor stands.
			The Academy of Raya Lucaria rises above the lake in the center of the region, at a junction between two highroads, with the Academy Gate Town spreading around it, slowly disappearing into the waters.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="carousel-item">
			  <img src="img/Caelid.webp" class="d-block w-100" alt="Caelid">
			<h3>Caelid</h3>
			<p>A wasteland on the south-eastern tip of the Lands Between,
			plagued by Scarlet Rot and inhabited by all manner of malformed creatures.
			Caelid was the site of the battle between General Radahn and Malenia, Blade of Miquella,
			during which the first flower of Aeonia bloomed and covered the region in Scarlet Rot.
			Radahn's army, the Redmanes, continue to combat the rot using fire to this day.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="carousel-item">
			  <img src="img/Altus_Plateau.webp" class="d-block w-100" alt="Altus_Plateau">
			<h3>Altus Plateau</h3>
			<p>The Altus Plateau is a northwestern region of the Lands Between.
			It is a region of great significance, for it is here that the Erdtree can be found, as well as Leyndell, the royal capital of Queen Marika.
			Altus borders Liurnia of the Lakes to the south, and the Forbidden Lands which lead to the Mountaintops of the Giants to the east.
			Due to its high elevation, Altus is connected to its neighbouring regions primarily through two lifts;
			the Grand Lift of Dectus to the south and the Grand Lift of Rold to the east.
			There is another, more dangerous path to Liurnia that goes through the mountains separating the two regions.</p>
			</div>
		 
			<div class="carousel-item">
			  <img src="img/Mt_Gelmir.webp" class="d-block w-100" alt="Mt_Gelmir">
			<h3>Mt. Gelmir</h3>
			<p>A volcano in western Altus Plateau, which houses the Volcano Manor at its summit.
			It is characterised by sheer cliffs and ominous skies; qualities which grew more pronounced in the wake of The Shattering.</p>
			
			<p>The Volcano Manor, which sits atop the mountain, is the home of the Demigod Praetor Rykard, who once led a company of inquisitors.
			After the Elden Ring was broken, Rykard fed himself to the blasphemous serpent, Great Rune and all, in defiance of the gods.
			His knights abandoned him when his noble ambitions were reduced to gluttony and depravity, yet his consort, Tanith, remained by his side.
			Rykard is now served by the Recusants; a band of Tarnished who hunt their own kind.</p>
			
			</div>
			
			<div class="carousel-item">
			  <img src="img/Mountaintops_of_the_Giants.webp" class="d-block w-100" alt="Mountaintops_of_the_Giants">
			<h3>Mountaintops of the Giants</h3>
			<p>The northern Mountaintops were once the home of the Fire Giants, after they claimed them from the ice dragons.
			At the birth of the Erdtree, the forces of Queen Marika the Eternal and Godfrey, First Elden Lord marched up the mountain and put the Giants to the sword.
			With the Giants defeated, the Flame of Ruin was confined within the Giants' Forge atop the mount, and the Age of the Erdtree began.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="carousel-item">
			  <img src="img/Consecrated_Snowfield.webp" class="d-block w-100" alt="Consecrated_Snowfield">
			<h3>Consecrated Snowfield</h3>
			<p>A snow-swept, misty area to the west of the Mountaintops of the Giants.
			The Consecrated Snowfield is final trial for those who seek Miquella's Haligtree,
			and can only be accessed by uniting the two halves of the Haligtree Secret Medallion,
			found in the Village of the Albinaurics and Castle Sol, and bringing them to the Grand Lift of Rold.</p>
			
			<p>Visibility is limited in many parts of the snowfield.
			Small, golden lights illuminate the path from the upper section to the broad, snowy plane below, through which a frozen river runs.
			In the south-west are the Yelough Anix Ruins, consumed by the Flame of Frenzy.
			Far to the north lies the Apostate Derelict, where the gentle yet towering sister of Latenna the Albinauric resides.
			South-east of there is Ordina, Liturgical Town, which hides the entrance to the Haligtree.
			There is also a waygate, tucked away on the western cliffs, which leads to Mohgwyn Palace.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="carousel-item">
			  <img src="img/Crumbling_Farum_Azula.webp" class="d-block w-100" alt="Crumbling_Farum_Azula">
			<h3>Crumbling Farum Azula</h3>
			<p>A giant temple in the sky, located above the sea to the east of the Lands Between.
			Once a royal city and the seat of the Dragonlord Placidusax, Farum Azula has been crumbling since time immemorial.
			Now, it is a mausoleum, guarded by chosen Beastmen who wield weapons clad in lightning.
			The storm beyond time rages in the centre of the crumbling city, and at its heart is the Dragonlord's seat, where he awaits the return of his god.</p>
